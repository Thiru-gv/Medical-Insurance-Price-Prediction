# Medical-Insurance-Price-Prediction
This project is a machine learning-based solution designed to predict medical insurance premiums based on various personal and lifestyle-related factors. It uses historical data to estimate the cost a person might incur for their health insurance, helping insurance providers and users make data-driven decisions.

🎯 Objectives
Predict the medical insurance cost of a person using ML algorithms.

Analyze the impact of key features like age, BMI, smoking status, and number of dependents.

Visualize correlations between different features and insurance charges.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data processing

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

scikit-learn – Model building (Linear Regression, Random Forest)

📁 Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:

Age

Gender

BMI (Body Mass Index)

Number of Children

Smoking status

Region

Insurance Charges (target variable)

Dataset source: Kaggle Medical Cost Dataset

🚀 Project Workflow
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handle missing values, encode categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize patterns and relationships between variables.

Model Training
Train models like Linear Regression and Random Forest.

Evaluation
Assess performance using metrics like R² score and MAE.

📊 Sample Output
Predicted charges vs actual charges plot

Feature importance visualization

Accuracy metrics display

📌 Future Improvements
Add a simple web interface using Flask or Streamlit.

Expand to real-time prediction using live input.

Deploy on a cloud platform like Heroku or Render.
